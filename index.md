## Oyster Restoration Project

The goal - keeping estuaries resilient in the face of global change. The primary goal of this project is to restore degraded chains of reefs in a way that is resilient both to sea level rise, and to continued low flows from the river. By so doing, we predict healthy reefs will buffer the estuaries from fluctuations in salinity, and from coastal erosion. The effects of this buffering should cascade to the fish, shellfish, birds and plant communities that humans care about, under a variety of future climate and 
sea level conditions.

## Project Data

Continous data are collected in nine sites with Star-Oddi and Diver sensors. The sites are located around the Lone Cabbage Reef in Cedar Key, FL. Discete measurements are also collected at these sites.

Sensor data site links are arranged in the order they lay near the Lone Cabbage Reef from North to South and West to East.  
[Site 6](http://rpubs.com/oysterproject/site6measurements),    [Site 1](http://rpubs.com/oysterproject/site1measurements),    [Site 7](http://rpubs.com/oysterproject/site7measurements)
  
[Site 5](http://rpubs.com/oysterproject/site5measurements), [Site 2](http://rpubs.com/oysterproject/site2measurements), [Site 8](http://rpubs.com/oysterproject/site8measurements) 
  
[Site 4](http://rpubs.com/oysterproject/site4measurements),  [Site 3](http://rpubs.com/oysterproject/site3measurements), [Site 9](http://rpubs.com/oysterproject/site9measurements)     

[Salinity and temperature figures](http://rpubs.com/oysterproject/allsalplots) are available for all nine site locations.

[Discrete lab results](http://rpubs.com/oysterproject/alllabresults) ,processed by Lakewatch UF, are available for Sites 1 through 6, for 2017.

Site data can be compared in the [Shiny App](https://oysterprojectck.shinyapps.io/mels-shiny/).
